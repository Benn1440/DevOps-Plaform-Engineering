# DevOps-Plaform-Engineering
This is a comprehensive and advanced DevOps/Platform Engineering task that touches on modern cloud-native patterns.

# Overview of the Components & Their Roles
- Kubernetes Cluster: The foundation. I'd use minikube for local development.

- Apache APISIX: Sits at the edge as the API Gateway and load balancer, routing external traffic to our services.

- Dapr: The distributed application runtime. It simplifies microservice communication (service invocation, pub/sub) and provides building blocks.

- Open Policy Agent (OPA) + OPA Gatekeeper: Used to enforce policies on the Kubernetes cluster itself. I'd create a policy to block direct Service-1 to Service-2 communication via NetworkPolicy.

- KEDA: Event-driven autoscaler for Kubernetes. You can use it to scale a service based on the length of the Kafka queue.

- Kafka: The message broker for the async Pub/Sub pattern facilitated by Dapr.

- YugabyteDB: A PostgreSQL-compatible distributed SQL database. The microservices will use it for persistence.

- Two Sample Microservices: Simple services order-service and user-service to demonstrate the patterns.

# Install Essential Tools in Your Shell

- `helm` to install complex applications and the `dapr` CLI to manage Dapr, and `minikube` for Kubernetes. <br><br>

For this project, I had to use these minikube specifications <br><br>
`benedictokafor@fyng-sys-bokafor ~ % minikube start --cpus=2 --memory=2200mb --disk-size=20g` <br><br>
